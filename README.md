# Weather Dashboard

## Description
 
Once using the application, the user can search for cities to get the current weather and 5 day forecast.  The information displayed to the user consists of:
– Weather conditions icon
– Temperature (in fahrenheit)
– Wind speed
– Humidity
 
The user can also quickly search previously searched cities by clicking the corresponding city in the "previously searched" section.
 
Developing this application taught me a lot more on APIs and how calling them in certain ways can deliver various data sets and how parameters can also interpret the data differently for you.
 
## Installation
 
To install and work on this code on your machine, clone down the HTML, CSS and JS files and open them in your favorite code editor.
 
Watchouts:
– This application uses some bootstrap 4.5.3 and jQuery 3.5.1. If you choose to use a different version some functionality may not work correctly.
– This application calls the free version of OpenWeather API. If you choose to use another version of this API, some functionality may not work correctly.
 
## Usage
 
Once live, the application allows the user to search for any city and view the current weather (temp, wind, humidity and icon of current conditions) along with a 5 day forecast. The user can also search for any locally stored cities with the click of a button.
